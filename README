The tool is essentially a wee-little dashboard for your linux server. It only supports a few system details at present(essentially handy little things python does) but I'll add more as I get the time, if you've any suggestions let me know.

Heres what it will check.

* If a process you're interested in is running. I use this for lighttpd and mysql.
* CPU Use
* Memory Use
* Internal IP
* External IP
( Free/Total Disk Space

Installation:

Basically do up the config file, put it somewhere then point to the config file from the main code. I actually execute it from my bashrc file, reason being is that typically when I need to ssh into my server it's to pull up one of these details.

Here is the sample config file is here:

running('apache')||running('mysqld')||running('stuff')
ext_ip('')||int_ip('')
free_space('')||total_space('')
cpu_use('')||mem_use('')
